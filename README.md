An Origami Website made by me using HTML/CSS

Things to add -

- More tutorials Page
- FAQ Page
- Contact us Page
- About Us Page
- Navigation Functions
- Smooth Slideshow
- Slideshow Image scaling

Things to consider adding in future -

- CSS Animations
- More color and style (looks kinda plain)
- One page for each tutorial
- Dropdowns that navigate to each page
- Topic wise distribution of tutorials

Things I will probably never be able to add, but are still pretty cool to consider - 

- 3D Folding Videos of the tutorials

That's it, I can't come up with more ideas than that, but if I do, I will surely add them here...
